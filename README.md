RADIOSENSE:

This is my first attempt at setting up a Django App. This app computes the sensitivity of a give radio telescope to find pulsars for a given set of parameters. It also takes into account the scattering of pulsars based on the DM. 

TO DO:
Make a similar sensitivity calculator for FRBs for a single pulse survey.
